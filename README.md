# Overview

My objective for this project was to learn and deepen my understanding of the C++ language by applying its core concepts to build a practical application.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my primary text editor.
The software was written in C++.
Libraries used: iostream, vector, string, fstream, limits

# Future Work

- Advanced Operations: Add more complex mathematical functions like square root, powers
- Try to modify the program to handle full expressions (e.g., 5 + 3 * 2) rather than requiring a number and operator on separate lines.
